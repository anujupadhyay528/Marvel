John is a MARVEL character who has a perfect aim in archery. Its almost impossible for him to miss his aim. As you are the head of technical team at MARVEL , you have been assigned a very critical task. During practice John uses a square archery practice board. For our convenience we will assume it to be a N * N matrix. He shoots an arrow at position i,j with power P. Now power reduces by 1 as we move away from position i,j . Your task is to show the graph representing the impact of the arrow on the practice board.
